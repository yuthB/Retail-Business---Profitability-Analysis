# Retail Business - Profitability Analysis
## Problem

Identify the sustainable (profitable) product categories so that the growth team can capitalise on them to increase sales. The data related to the problem can be accessed [here]. [This] image contains ERD for the schema.

## Metrics

Some of the metrics that can be used for performing the profitability analysis are as follows:

- Profits per product category
- Profits per product subcategory
- Average profit per order
- Average profit percentage per order

## Tables
The tables that I will be using to solve this problem are as follows:

- 'market_fact_full'
- 'prod_dimen'
- 'orders_dimen'

** Work on the project is still in progress
